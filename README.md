# onionsDamageLog

Didn't feel like finishing this
If you have a huge IQ then it should be pretty easy to finish
I may finish in the future the only thing left is the drawing of the HUD
all the logging is done and stored properly with tables dumped on disconnect and storing named hitboxes names ids and damage and checks to make sure it's the local player.

My idea was just to recreate fatalities damage logs :clown:
also I didn't make the code clean like older projects because I don't care enough anymore about it
